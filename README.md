# tagrepo

A hybrid tag-hierarchy file manager. This is extremely early in development.

## Todo

Database:

- use [slash paths](https://docs.rs/path-slash/latest/path_slash/) for paths
- ensure tags are alphabetically ordered

Query

- allow querying based on parent folder path
- make sure querying still works without the `#all` token

Frontend

- study virtualized list implementations then build your own
- 2 views: row / gallery
